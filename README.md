Optimal time under tension workouts are done at greater than 60% 1 rep max.   Depending on targeted muscle group, duration should be min.30 to 60 seconds.

* This project is brand new, I wouldn't even call it code at this point because I wanted to keep everything outside of loops until I figure out each variable and ratio.  * Each jupyter notebook will focus on a single day's routine. The bottom of each notebook will include notes about how the workout went.  I will then copy the notebook and label it as the next sequential version once a workout has proven itself consistent for 2 weeks I will try to condense what works into object that can be called upon for different meso-cycles.  The first type of workout I am working on is a focus on time-under-tension.  The next cycle will probably be a higher weight lower rep weight progression keeping within the 6-8 rep range.
